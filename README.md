# RRC Polytech Full-Stack Development Demo Application
## Overview
This application is meant to serve as a glossary for development terms and acronyms in a Software Development context.

Users can build glossaries of terms that they find themselves using frequently in their development environments. Terms may have definitions that apply in different contexts, which a user may switch at any point. 

For example, the definition of a *repository* will change based on if a User is viewing it through a **Source Control**/`git` context, or a **Design Pattern** context.

## Requirements
- Individually authenticated users can collect their own lists of definitions or use pre-built libraries for different contexts.

- Users may add their own notes to a definition

- Each definition can have proposed edits/comments added by multiple users. These can receive votes and can be sorted by votes.
